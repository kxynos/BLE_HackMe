                    You are undoubtely familiar with Bluetooth, and most likely use it every day - for example in wireless mouse, headset or car audio. 
                Despite sharing common name, Bluetooth Low Energy is however a different technology.
                As the name implies - it aims to preserve energy, hence typical applications include rather occasional exchange of small data packets. 
                Most common usage scenarios include:

                <Paragraph Margin="10,0,0,0">
                    - a <Bold>Broadcaster</Bold> that transmits some one-way data ("<Bold>Advertisement</Bold>") to all nearby
                    <Bold>Observers</Bold> (for example a "beacon" device broadcasting indoor location to nearby phones)

                <Paragraph Margin="10,0,0,0">
                    - BLE Client ("<Bold>Central</Bold>", for example mobile application) to Server ("<Bold>Peripheral</Bold>", for example smart lock) communication

                    If everything went correctly, the HackMe application should now be broadcasting BLE packets. Let's see if it works! 
                Probably the easiest way is to use your smartphone, and there are several free applications to do the job. 
                The recommended one is
                    <Hyperlink NavigateUri="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Connect-for-mobile">nRF Connect</Hyperlink> - for its unique features including low-level BLE debug information and macro scripts.
                    It is available for both <Hyperlink NavigateUri="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp">Android</Hyperlink> and
                    <Hyperlink NavigateUri="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-connect/id1054362403">iOS</Hyperlink>,
                    however iOS version lacks several important features required to solve many of the upcoming tasks.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    For Bluetooth access, Android
                    <Hyperlink NavigateUri="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth#Permissions">requires</Hyperlink> location permission from the application, 
                    so you will have to grant it during installation.
                    Once started, the application will show nearby BLE devices. 
                    Beside optional device name, you will notice the device's adapter address, 
                    bonding (pairing) information, as well as signal strength (swiping to right will show its change in time) and frequency of the broadcasted packets (delay in ms).
                    For connectable devices, there is also optional "CONNECT" button:

                    Depending on your environment, you may see lots of BLE packets, and it might be difficult to locate your HackMe device.
                    One of the ways to limit the list of discovered devices is to use filtering (select down arrow by the "No filter"), for example based on the signal strength (RSSI). 
                    It is measured in decibels (dBm), and the lower value means stronger signal. To match only the nearest devices, slide the RSSI value to about "-60":

                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    Note that scanning will automatically stop after a while ("STOP SCANNING" -> "SCAN"), and it may be needed to start again.
