                    By completing previous task, you learned how to write a value to characteristic.
                Now it is time to get familiar with two types of write:
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph Margin="10,0,0,0">
                    - <Bold>Write Request</Bold> (visible as "WRITE" property in nRF Connect) - the receiving device sends confirmation (write response)
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph Margin="10,0,0,0">
                    - <Bold>Write Command</Bold> (visible as "WRITE NO RESPONSE" property in nRF Connect) - without confirmation
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph Margin="0,5,0,0">
                    Characteristic can have just one of the write type properties, or both. 
                    Most tools and applications automatically choose the best available one, usually prefering the Write Request (with confirmation).
                    Some devices however, despite declaring both types of write as characteristic properties, 
                    actually process just one of them. Therefore in some cases it may be required to manually choose the write type.
                </Paragraph>

                    Within the light bulb service, find another characteristic responsible for Text To Speech functionality.
                    It transforms the received text into speech, and our HackMe light bulb talks it back to you (turn your speaker on to hear it).
                    Your task is to make the light bulb say "Hello". Note that this characteristic may interpret just one type of write.
                </Paragraph>

                    The job consists of few tasks:

                    <Bold>2. Figure out how to send a text to this characteristic</Bold>
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph Margin="10,0,0,0">
                    The low level data, trasmitted to and from characteristics, is in hex.
                    The most common way of encoding UTF characters to hex is Ascii Hex representation.
                    For example, "Hi" translates into 0x48 0x69 ("4869" as raw bytes stream).
                    You can use for example "to hex" recipe in 
                    <Hyperlink NavigateUri="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/">CyberChef</Hyperlink> to try it out.
                    </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph Margin="10,5,0,0">
                    For convenience, the nRF Connect allows to automatically encode various input types 
                - including several numeric formats as well as text to hex. 
                    The feature is available as select down option right next to value entry form in "Write" function.
                </Paragraph>

                <Paragraph Margin="10,0,0,0">
                    nRF Connect will automatically select the more reliable Write Request with confirmations (unless only Write Command is available).
                    Choose the "Advanced" option in write form to select write type.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph Margin="0,5,0,0">
                    Of course once you succeed in greeting the light bulb "Hello" to solve the task, you are free to send to it any text you like.

                <Paragraph Margin="0,5,0,0">
                    <Bold>Note</Bold>: if the HackMe application crashes after sending valid command, 
                    your system (for example Windows Pro "N") may lack media pack required for TTS functionality.
                    Please install "Microsoft Media Feature Pack".
