                    So far you have passively observed advertisements transmitted by your HackMe device.
                    It was basically one way communication from Broadcaster to nearby Observers (your smartphone).
                The data was publicly available and no pairing was required.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    Now, you will finally connect and explore another use scenario: where a GATT Client ("Central", your smartphone) connects to GATT Server ("Peripheral", your BLE HackMe device).
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    The GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) is another Bluetooth specification, which organizes data exchange between connected devices.
                The main concept introduced here includes so-called Attributes, especially Services and Characteristics:
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph Margin="10,0,0,0">
                    - A <Bold>Service</Bold> groups sub-objects (Characteristics) by specific functionality.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph Margin="10,0,0,0">
                    - A <Bold>Characteristic</Bold> is an object holding some information (Value), which can be read or written to.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph Margin="0,10,0,0">
                    The access rights (read/notify/write) are defined in Characteristic's <Bold>Properties</Bold>.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    Each Service and Characteristic has an
                    <Bold>UUID</Bold> associated. The commonly used UUIDs (for example "battery level", "heart rate", ...) are registered by Bluetooth SIG, 
                    and have a short (16-bit) form. For example: Device Name Characteristic: 0x2A00, Battery Level Characteristic: 0x2A19.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    For proprietary use, for example switching on/off specific vendor's BLE smart light bulb, manufacturers use their own, full length UUIDs.
                    They can be randomly generated and don't need to be registered and assigned by Bluetooth organization. Just the associated mobile application (or other connecting device) needs to know it.
                </Paragraph>

                    Your HackMe device should be visible again as your computer hostname (scan again to find it).
                Use the "Connect" button to initiate connection. The application will show the list of BLE "services" available on the device.
                Some services (including Generic Access and Generic Attribute) are mandatory, and you should see them in every BLE device.

                    Tap on a service name in order to expand characteristics inside of this service. Note the characteristic UUIDs and Properties displayed in the application.
